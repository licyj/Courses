# Homework1: Decision Tree

## Requirement
Implement the Binary Decision Tree Classifier with the given dataset(“heart_dataset.csv”).
Fill the function of attachment "DecisionTree.py"

## Coding(85%)
●	implement  _entropy (5%)

●	implement _feature_split(10%)

●	implement _build_tree (10%)

●	implement fit (5%)

●	implement predict (5%)

●	implement _find_leaves (5%)

●	implement _error_before_cut (5%)

●	Implement _compute_alpha (10%)

●	Implement _find_min_alpha (20%)

●	Implement _prune(10%)

## Report(15%)
1.	Design  _feature_split, _build_tree, _find_min_alpha, _prune, and then explain the goal of each function .

2.	Decision tree before post pruning accuracy

3.	Decision tree after post pruning accuracy

4.	The effect of different parameters 
    > (Ex: prune tree times、max_depth)

5.	A brief discussion of the results
    > (Ex: After prune tree, will the testing accuracy be better, if yes, why it would be better, if not, why it be worse?)
